    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p>Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains nutrients—substances essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. Nutrients provide the energy our bodies need to function.
        The energy in food is measured in units called calories. Age, sex, weight, height, and level of activity determine the number of calories a person needs each day. Depending on age, sex, and activity level, the recommended daily caloric intake
        for a child aged 11 to 14 can range anywhere from 1,600 to 2,600 calories per day, with sedentary girls needing the fewest calories and active boys needing the most. For adults, this can range from 1,800 to about 3,000.</p>

    <h3>Pizza</h3>
    <p>Pizza, a dish of Italian origin consisting of a flat disk of bread dough topped with a mixture of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olive, mozzarella, or other cheese, and several other ingredients, is baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using
        a heated wood-fired oven. At a very high temperature, it is served hot.</p>

    <h3>Musakhan</h3>
    <p>Musakhan is the national dish of Palestine, and it is as delicious as it is unique. Definitely one of my favorite things to eat. When cooked well, it makes you want to eat your fingers afterwards, as the Arabic expression goes. It's an easy recipe
        to make but hard to get right. It basically consists of chicken, onions, sumac, bread and olive oil. The trick is to get the perfect balance between well-cooked chicken and soft breading with just enough crunch.</p>


    <h3>Maqluba</h3>
    <p>Maqluba (Arabic: مقلوبة) is a traditional Iraqi, Lebanese, Palestinian, Jordanian, and Syrian dish served throughout the Levant. It consists of meat, rice, and fried vegetables placed in a bowl, then turned upside down when served, hence the name
        maqluba, which literally translates as “upside down.” This dish dates back centuries and is found in the Cookbook, a collection of 13th century recipes.</p>
